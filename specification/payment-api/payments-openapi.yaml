        The /v5/payments/credit endpoint was introduced with relaxed validation

        during downstream processing.


        Clients that require strict, fail-fast validation should continue using the v4 endpoint. The v5 endpoint is not recommended for general use.

        Initiates a batch of internal fund transfers arranged in a waterfall
        sequence.

        Each payment in the batch is executed in priority order defined by its `paymentIndex`,

        where funds flow from the debtor to the creditor specified in each payment. The waterfall design

        allows funds to cascade through multiple accounts sequentially within the bank.

        **Note:** This API is restricted to use by authorized financial institutions only.

            3. For Payment speed = Economy Plus, if the payment is submitted/created today before cut-off, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            4. For Payment speed = Economy and if submitted/created for today before cut-off time, then the transaction shall have effective entry date of two days or one day after submission (T+2 or T+1) depending on your bank’s configuration. For Payment speed = Economy and if submitted on (12th Aug) for delivery date (on 16th Aug) before cut-off time, then the transaction shall be sent to beneficiary on 14th Aug assuming the configuration is two days prior to paymentDate.

            This value is not required to be unique and may be reused across multiple

            credit and debit payment requests. The API does not enforce uniqueness.


            **externalReferenceId** does not provide idempotency. Clients must use the

            `Idempotent-Key` request header to prevent duplicate processing.

            For the Fedwire payment, this will be mapped to the {2000} tag.


            ❗ **Zero (`0`) is only allowed for ENR (Automated Enrollment Entry) payments.**

            For all other payment types, the amount must be **greater than zero**.

              - The drawdown feature is currently not supported via OpenAPI. Therefore, when using FX Trade-based payments,
            the `paymentAmount` must exactly match the FX Trade amount.


            Payment rail limits per transaction:
              - RTP: up to $1,000,000
              - FedNow: up to $500,000

            - For international payments, non-USD payment currency must match the receiver currency.

            - Payment currency must match either sender or receiver currency.

            - For FX trades, payment currency must match the trade currency.

            This is an optional field and signifies the date on which the Finzly system will settle the payment. If the paymentDate is not provided by the API user BankOS will derive it for the earliest available settlement date (not prior to the current business date), based on the configuration.


            ACH Payments are typically settled two days after the current date.


            *SWIFT systems do not allow users to initiate payments on holidays or weekends.*


            Payment requests via API can be submitted using the following example guidelines:


            **Examples:**


            1. For Payment speed = Express (Wires), if the payment is submitted/created today* before cut-off, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            2. For Payment speed = Instant (FedNow, RTP), if the payment is submitted/created today before, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            3. For Payment speed = Economy Plus, if the payment is submitted/created today before cut-off, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            4. For Payment speed = Economy and if submitted/created for today before cut-off time, then the transaction shall have effective entry date of two days or one day after submission (T+2 or T+1) depending on your bank’s configuration. For Payment speed = Economy and if submitted on (12th Aug) for delivery date (on 16th Aug) before cut-off time, then the transaction shall be sent to beneficiary on 14th Aug assuming the configuration is two days prior to paymentDate.


            * today being business day
          example: 05-08-2024
        speed:

          description: >
            Specifies the delivery speed of the payment, which determines how
            quickly the funds will be delivered and the associated fee.

            Valid values are predefined and mapped to specific payment rails, as configured by the bank or financial institution.


            **Supported Speed Names and Rails (default configuration in FinzlyOS):**

            - Economy: ACH (Regular)

            - Economy Plus: ACH (Same Day)

            - Express: Fedwire

            - Instant: FedNow or RTP

            - ON, TN, SPOT: SWIFT


            **Validation Rules:**

            - If the provided speed value is not recognized or not configured for the given currency/payment type, the payment cannot proceed.

            - If the speed value is missing, invalid, or not supported for the contact or currency pair, payment initiation will fail.

                    A cost center is a department or function within an organization—such as Accounting, Human Resources, or IT—that incurs costs but does not directly contribute to profit.


                    The provided cost center value must already exist in the system configuration.

                    If it does not exist, the transaction will be rejected. Please ensure a valid cost center is used.

            This is an optional field and signifies the date on which the Finzly system will settle the payment. If the paymentDate is not provided by the API user BankOS will derive it for the earliest available settlement date (not prior to the current business date), based on the configuration.


            ACH Payments are typically settled two days after the current date.


            *SWIFT systems do not allow users to initiate payments on holidays or weekends.*


            Payment requests via API can be submitted using the following example guidelines:


            **Examples:**


            1. For Payment speed = Express (Wires), if the payment is submitted/created today* before cut-off, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            2. For Payment speed = Instant (FedNow, RTP), if the payment is submitted/created today before, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            3. For Payment speed = Economy Plus, if the payment is submitted/created today before cut-off, it will be sent to beneficiary today itself.

            4. For Payment speed = Economy and if submitted/created for today before cut-off time, then the transaction shall have effective entry date of two days or one day after submission (T+2 or T+1) depending on your bank’s configuration. For Payment speed = Economy and if submitted on (12th Aug) for delivery date (on 16th Aug) before cut-off time, then the transaction shall be sent to beneficiary on 14th Aug assuming the configuration is two days prior to paymentDate.


            * today being business day
          example: 05-08-2024
        speed:
          type: string
          description: >
            Specifies the delivery speed of the payment, which determines how
            quickly the funds will be delivered and the associated fee.

            Valid values are predefined and mapped to specific payment rails, as configured by the bank or financial institution.


            **Supported Speed Names and Rails (default configuration in FinzlyOS):**

            - Economy: ACH (Regular)

            - Economy Plus: ACH (Same Day)

            - Express: Fedwire

            - Instant: FedNow or RTP

            - ON, TN, SPOT: SWIFT


            **Validation Rules:**

            - If the provided speed value is not recognized or not configured for the given currency/payment type, the payment cannot proceed.

            - If the speed value is missing, invalid, or not supported for the contact or currency pair, payment initiation will fail.
          example: Economy
        paymentNotes:

            Notes added by the payment originator. These notes will be truncated
            to the maximum allowed length and passed to the payment network
            according to rail-specific limits :


            - ACH: up to 10 characters

            - Fedwire: up to 140 characters (Tag 6400 - Beneficiary Info)

            - SWIFT: up to 140 characters (Tag 70)

            - RTP/FedNow: up to 140 characters (ISO 20022 - RmtInf tag)


            `paymentNotes` is required for **ACH** and **SWIFT** payments.

                    Ensure the selected value is valid for the country involved in the transaction, as certain bank ID types may not be supported in all countries.

                    depending on the bankIdType.


                    - For NID (ABA/Routing number), the value must be exactly 9 digits and cannot consist entirely of zeros.

                    - For SWIFT codes, the value must be between 8 and 11 characters.

                    - The bank ID must be valid and pre-configured in the CRM system. If it does not exist, the system will reject it.

                    - For payments using the Fedwire rail, this bankId is mapped to the {3100} tag in the payment message format.

                    It is primarily applicable for **international Fedwire payments**, where the receiver bank's country is outside the United States.


                    If this field is left blank for an international Fedwire payment, the Finzly system will automatically retrieve the correspondent bank details from its internal configuration, based on the receiver’s country and currency setup.
